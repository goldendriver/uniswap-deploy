# How to deploy Uniswap

## Background
This article provides step-by-step instructions for installing [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) V1 on any [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) compatible blockchain.

Some [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) compatible blockchains include:
* [ParaTime](https://docs.oasis.dev/general/faq/oasis-network-faq) - built in collaboration by [Oasis Foundation](https://oasisprotocol.org/) & [SecondState](https://www.secondstate.io/) as announced [here](https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/ethereum-support-on-the-oasis-blockchain-3add9e13556).
* [CyberMiles](https://www.cybermiles.io/en-us/) - a public blockchain for E-commerce.
* [Ethereum Classic](https://ethereumclassic.org/) - Ethereum (ETH) blockchain network initially released on 30 July 2015, now known as Ethereum Classic (ETC).

### Uniswap V1
[Uniswap V1](https://uniswap.org/docs/v1/), was [launched in November 2018](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1058376395108376577) on the Ethereum mainnet as a set of 2 [Vyper](https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) smart contracts. Uniswap is an automated liquidity protocol which facilitates token exchanges on the Ethereum blockchain network. Uniswap has seen daily trading volumes of well beyond four hundred million dollars ($400, 000, 000 / day). 

[This tweet](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1300034164830408704) shows that Uniswap surpasses the daily Coinbase trade volume on occasion.

#### Smart contracts
The [Factory](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v1/blob/master/contracts/uniswap_factory.vy) and [Exchange](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v1/blob/master/contracts/uniswap_exchange.vy) Vyper smart contracts of Uniswap V1 contain all of the logic for the Uniswap protocol. These smart contracts are permissionless in nature and therefore Uniswap V1 will exist for as long as Ethereum does.

## Uniswap V2
The most recent version of Uniswap, V2, includes a number of tangible improvements over V1. Uniswap V2 was [launched in May 2020](https://uniswap.org/blog/launch-uniswap-v2/) on the Ethereum mainnet [at block 10000835](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5C69bEe701ef814a2B6a3EDD4B1652CB9cc5aA6f#code) as a single [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) smart contract.

#### Smart contracts
Uniswap V2's [core Solidity smart contracts](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-core/tree/master/contracts) contain the logic which allows the Uniswap automated liquidity protocol to operate.

### Front-end
Whilst it is posible to interact with Uniswap via smart contract function executions (in the command line/terminal), the official [front-end web application](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-interface) provides a much nicer user experience; facilitating trading via mouse clicks and also facilitating wallet integration via browser extensions such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/).

The image above shows the [entry point to the official Uniswap interface](https://uniswap.org/). This front end allows users on the web to switch between Uniswap V1 and Uniswap V2 using a simple `V1` `V2` toggle (as shown in the upper right corner of the image below).
